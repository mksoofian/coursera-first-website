# coursera-first-website
/* This web page was built as my graded assesment for HTML and CSS In Depth Course on Coursera as part of my Front End Development Certification. 
We were challenged to follow a given template and use a fictional company as our design theme. I used psuedo classes and animations to elevate this 
from a basic static website to one that has more interactivity and engagement. */
